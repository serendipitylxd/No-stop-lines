# No-Stop-Line Detection in Sea Locks ðŸš¢

This project focuses on **intelligent detection of no-stop lines in ship locks**, ensuring navigation safety in inland waterways. 
Due to the complex operating environment influenced by **tides, waves, airflow, and dense ship traffic**, conventional detection methods often suffer from false alarms and low robustness. 

**Highlights**: 
* The code has been published, (Sep. 2025)
* The code supports one-click operation.
* The code supports the operation of 2D and 3D models in a multi-conda environment

## Changelog
[2025-09-03] `TROUT` v0.1.0 is released. 


## Introduction
We propose a **multimodal fusion approach** that integrates **2D image detection** and **3D LiDAR point cloud detection**, combined with **lock gate presence recognition** and **quality-aware non-maximum suppression (NMS)**, to achieve accurate and reliable violation detection. 

Main contributions:
- âœ… Fusion of 2D and 3D detection results.
- âœ… Gate state detection mechanism to avoid false alarms when gates are open.
- âœ… Dual violation rules: *line-crossing* & *zone intrusion*.
- âœ… Quality optimization of 3D detections with **outdoor proportion constraint + rotational IoU deduplication**.

### How to use TROUT data sets for training and evaluation

Before running the code, you need to open **configs/config.yaml**,**scripts/run_all.py** and make relevant modifications according to the environment you have configured.

Run the full pipeline (2D + 3D detection, fusion, check, evaluation, visualization):

```shell
python scripts/run_all.py --cfg configs/config.yaml
```

Run with all modules disabled (You can skip certain modules according to your needs):

```shell
python scripts/run_all.py --cfg configs/config.yaml --no-2d --no-3d --no-check --no-viz --no-eval
```
